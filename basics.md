## Version control

### What are version control tools?

- Version control is a tool that can **record snapshots of a project**.
- You can think of version control like regularly taking a photo of your work
  (movie sets take regular polaroids to be able to recreate a scene the next day).

```


### What we typically like to version control (or "snapshot")?

- Software (this is how it started but Git/GitHub can track a lot more)
- Scripts
- Documents (plain text file much better suitable than Word documents)
- Manuscripts (Git is great for collaborating/sharing LaTeX manuscripts)
- Configuration files
- Website sources
- Data


### Why are snapshots valuable? Reproducibility!

- We can always go back if we make a mistake.
- We can test new ideas without editing the working version
- If we discover a problem, we can find out when it was introduced.
- We have the means to refer to a well-defined version of a project when sharing, collaborating, and publishing.

## Difference between [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com)

**Git**
- Tool that can record and synchronize snapshots.
- Not the only tool that can record snapshots (other popular tools are
[Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org) and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org)).
- Not only a tool but also a format that can be read by many different tools.

**GitHub**
- Service that provides hosting for Git repositories with a nice web interface.
- Not the only service that provides this (other popular services are
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)).

**GitHub Desktop**
- Graphical user interface to Git and GitHub which runs locally on your computer.
- There are other tools that can do this, too (e.g. [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)).

## Commits, branches, repositories, forks, clones

- **repository**: The project, contains all data and history (commits, branches, tags).
- **branch**: Independent development line, often we call the main development line `master`.
- **commit**: Snapshot of the project, gets a unique identifier (e.g. `c7f0e8bfc718be04525847fc7ac237f470add76e`).
- **tag**: A pointer to one commit, to be able to refer to it later. Like a sticky note that you attach to a particular commit (e.g. `phd-printed` or `paper-submitted`).
- **cloning**: Copying the whole repository to your laptop - the first time. It is not necessary to download each file one by one.
- **forking**: Taking a copy of a repository (which is typically not yours) - your
  copy (fork) stays on GitHub and you can make changes to your copy.

> ## Why use repositories? Think of your usecases for the following:
>
> - All changes are recorded.
> - We do not have to send changes via email.
> - We can experiment with several ideas which might not work out (using branches).
> - Several people can work on the same project at the same time (using branches).
> - We do not have to wait for others to send us "the latest version" over email.
> - We do not have to merge parallel developments by hand.
> - Group-based access model where shared access is the default, instead of
>   everything fundamentally owned by individuals who manage sharing as-needed:
>   with Git you can easily have collaboration be the default.
> - It is possible to serve websites directly from a repository.
