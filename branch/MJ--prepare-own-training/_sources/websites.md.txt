# Hosting websites/homepages on GitHub Pages

You can host your personal homepage or group webpage
or project website on GitHub using
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) and
[Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html)
also offer a very similar solution.

Unless you need user authentication or a sophisticated database behind your website,
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) can be a very nice alternative
to running your own web servers.

This is how all
[https://coderefinery.org](https://coderefinery.org)
material is hosted.


## Exercise

- Deploy own website reusing a template
- Make a change to the website after it has been deployed for the first time
- Verify that the change shows up on the website a minute or two later

The documentation for GitHub Pages is very good so no need for us to duplicate

> ## Discussion
>
> - You can use HTML directly or another static site generator if you prefer
>   to not use the default [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
> - It is no problem to use a custom domain instead of `*.github.io`.
