# Creating repositories using the web interface

We will practice creating a new repository using the web interface, committing
changes to it, browsing the changes, creating branches, and more.
This is everything you need to do basic file management, though you'll
probably want something faster to use.  Still, it can be good for
quick edits and contributions.

In small groups it can be useful to do this side by side (in-person) or one
learner shares their screen (video) and others can ask questions and give
suggestions. In a larger group the instructor can demonstrate these and then
participants can try on their own and then ask questions.



```{instructor-note}
In this episode we are all in the main room and do these steps together as
follow-along with pauses with time for questions and answers, no breakout rooms
yet.

## Step 1: Create a repository with a README and a license

You start off by creating a repository from the web.  In fact, we
usually end up doing this from the web, no matter how you do your daily
work.  The important questions are who is the *owner* and what is the
*name* of the repository.

Make sure that you are **logged into GitHub**.

To create a repository we either click the green button "New" (top left corner):
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/new-top-left.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

---

Or if you see your profile page, there is a "+" menu (top right corner):
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/new-top-right.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

---

Yet another way to create a new repository is to visit
[https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new) directly.

---

We then land at the following form.  Please fill it out and set **Initialize
this repository with a README** and choose a license.  If you don't find a
suitable license, we will show later how you can add your own.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/form.png" width="600px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

---

And now we have a repository with a README and LICENSE and one commit:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/created.png" width="600px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

---

## Step 2: Create a new file

We can easily add new files from the web interface.

Create a file, e.g. `guacamole.md` (the "md" ending signals that this is in Markdown format):
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/new-file-buttons.png" width="600px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

In the new file you can share your favorite cooking recipe (or something else).
You can also copy-paste this as a starting point:
```
Ingredients:
- 2 avocados
- 1 lime
- 2 tsp salt

Instructions:
- cut and mash avocados
- chop onion
- squeeze lime
- add salt
- and mix well
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/new-file-editor.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

Then add a commit message and commit (save):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/new-file-commit.png" width="600px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

> - ["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

## Step 3: Modify a file

We can also easily modify files from the web.

Now improve the recipe by adding an ingredient or an instruction step:
- Click on the file.
- Click the "pen" icon on top right ("edit this file").

Make an improvement, write a commit message, commit:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/edit-file-preview.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

Once you have done that, browse your commits:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/commits-browse.png" width="300px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

In my example I got:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/commits-example.png" width="800px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

---

## Step 4: Create a new branch

A **branch** is a separate line of development. They are useful when
you have multiple things going on at once and you don't want them to
get in the way of each other.  It also allows collaboration, as we
will learn in the next episode.

- Create a new branch:
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/create-branch.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">
- Modify your recipe on the newly created branch. Make sure you commit to the new branch:
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/commit-experiment-branch.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">
- Then switch back to the `master` branch and browse your recipe there. Compare the file on both branches.

---

## Step 5: How can we merge branches?
_This is an optional step which the instructor may demonstrate and discuss._

We made a separate branch, separate from the main branch `master`.
What happens when we decide we like that change, and want to take it
into use?  We will soon see the magic of Git.

First browse to the overview of all branches:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/branches-click.png" width="400px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

Now to initiate a merge (request), click on "New pull request":
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/branches-overview.png" width="800px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

Once a "pull request" (think of it as a change proposal) is open, it can be
reviewed and merged. We will return to "pull requests" when we later discuss
how to contribute changes.

---

## Step 6: Repository insights and settings
_This is an optional step which the instructor may demonstrate and discuss._

Github gives us many insights into our repository.  Nothing here is
really specific to Github (everything can be done with regular Git),
but they make it especially easy to see.  The **network** lets you see
how all commits and branches relate.

Have a look at the network, hover over the dots in the graph
(commits).  The network view is the best way to get an overview of
your branches and commits, and it never hurts to come back here and
check:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/network.png" width="800px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">

---

## Step 7: Adding a license to an existing repository
_This is an optional step which the instructor may demonstrate and discuss._

How to add a license to an existing repository:

- Visit [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/) and let it guide you.
- If you don't find a suitable license,
  choose among [https://choosealicense.com/appendix/](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/).
- Once you have chosen, click on the license name, and you can enter your GitHub repository URL (top right)
  which will open a pull request (change request) to the repository:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/creating-using-web/choosealicense.png" width="800px" style="border:2px solid #000000;">
