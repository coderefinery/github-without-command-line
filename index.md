# Non-technical introduction to Git via GitHub. Almost no command line required.

In this tutorial we will start out with a super brief introduction to Git and
GitHub and exercise useful workflows within GitHub. As an example, we will
practice to implement changes to a repository and test and review these
changes before they are integrated in the main repository.


## Requirements

- [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- Bring your laptop with wireless network connectivity
- Linux and Mac OS X users: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Windows users: [Install Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)


## Not required

- Previous knowledge of Git or GitHub
- Knowledge of the command line


## Why [GitHub](https://github.com)?

We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
[GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
choose to host your Git repository on another platform.

We also encourage course participants to use our new [Nordic research software repository platform](https://source.coderefinery.org),
for more information see [http://coderefinery.org/repository/](http://coderefinery.org/repository/).
